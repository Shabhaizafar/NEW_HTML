    <h1> What is Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of building, programming, and maintaining websites and web applications. It
        involves
        a wide range of tasks, including coding, technical design, and performance optimization.
        The field is typically divided into three main areas: front-end development, back-end development, and
        full-stack
        development. </p>

    <p>Front-end development focuses on the user interface (UI) and the visual elements of a website or application,
        using
        languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Back-end development deals with the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the website behind the
        scenes.
    </p>
    <p>Full-stack development combines both front-end and back-end tasks, allowing developers to handle the entire
        development process.
    </p>
    <p>Web development also includes the creation of web applications, which are software packages that run on a web
        server
        and are accessed through the internet.
    </p>
    <p>The process involves markup, coding, network configuration, and content management systems (CMS).
        Web developers use various programming languages and tools to create functional and efficient websites, ensuring
        a
        smooth user experience.
